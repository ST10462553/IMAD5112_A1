# IMAD5112_A1 - Creating a history-filled android application by ST10462553

# A functional Android application project written in Kotlin to enable users to input their age, prompting the app to  dislay information about historical figures and their age of passing.

This assignment was built to test the knowledge of students and to make an attempt towards building an application that may become useful or educational to potential users. Every aspect of this assignment is sample code which makes an attempt at reaching its goals and objectives towards the following:
* Enable the intake of user input specifically based on the age of the user
* Ensure that once a user inputs their age on the app, the app displays a message informing the user of the significance of the age inputted(by informing them of a famous figure who passed at that particular age).
* The user has the option of clearing their age history, thus the app resets and the user can enter either a new age or the same one to get a different famous figure's information.
* Error handling-wise, the app should prevent users from inputing values such as "37.5".The age must strictly be an integer "37", likeso.
* A functioning UI for user's convinient experience while navigating the app.

## Issues and pointers to take note of(work in progress):
## Please take note that this assignment is still in progress and I am still making it a point to perfect this assignment. With that being said I would like to give out a few pointers (regarding issues you may run into):

*The program may crash upon entering due to some syntax errors ( specifically overload errors) that I have run into.
*The button functionality process is still in progress and will be adressed once the issue is handled.
* I have created a function on the application that will enable a user to tap a vector art image (in the app) and automatically be redirected to wikipedia. - This was to further give light and educate users of the figure in the picture.( namely, Amy Winehouse).
