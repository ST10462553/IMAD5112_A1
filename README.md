# IMAD5112_A1 - Creating a history-filled android application by ST10462553

# A functional Android application project written in Kotlin to enable users to input their age, prompting the app to  dislay information about historical figures and their age of passing.

# This assignment was built to test the knowledge of students and to make an attempt towards building an application that may become useful or educational to potential users. Every aspect of this assignment is sample code which makes an attempt at reaching its goals and objectives towards the following:
* Enable the intake of user input specifically based on the age of the user
* Ensure that once a user inputs their age on the app, the app displays a message informing the user of the significance of the age inputted(by informing them of a famous figure who passed at that particular age).
* The user has the option of clearing their age history, thus the app resets and the user can enter either a new age or the same one to get a different famous figure's information.
* Error handling-wise, the app should prevent users from inputing values such as "37.5".The age must strictly be an integer "37", likeso.
* A functioning UI for user's convinient experience while navigating the app.

## Issues and pointers to take note of(work in progress):
## Please take note that this assignment is still in progress and I am still making it a point to perfect this assignment. With that being said I would like to give out a few pointers (regarding issues you may run into):

* The program may crash upon entering due to some syntax errors ( specifically overload errors) that I have run into.
* The button functionality process is still in progress and will be adressed once the issue is handled.
* I have created a function on the application that will enable a user to tap a vector art image (in the app) and automatically be redirected to wikipedia. - This was to further give light and educate users of the figure in the picture.( namely, Amy Winehouse).
  ## Image(s) appearing in the app:

## Purpose of the assignment:
* The purpose of this project is having to gain knowledge on how to implement basic coding skills in Kotlin (programming language). during the course of this project i have learnt how to do basic designing throught the use of android studio. android studio is basically an IDE ( Integrated development environment), software that assists programmers to code more efficiently, either by pointing suggestions, syntax errors or typos made in the code. During the coarse of this project I have learnt concepts such as:
* differenciating between "var" and "val"- to explain deeply into these two concepts, once "var" is declared in code it enables the programmer to let the program change values as oppossed to "val" , which aims to keep a value the same and prevents any change being done.
* In the process of making this project, I've learnt how to track my progress in programming by "recording" or "journaling" through making a Github reposetary and making a ReadMe file. Which, I believe is a staple aspect in programming considering the fact that projects.
* I gained an experience is designing an application through the use of the activity main.xml file (Android Studio)

 ## How to make a github repository from scratch:
  1. sign in using your email, mobile number,etc
  2. Github will then request you to type in a login code(this is if you are signing in from a different account)
  3. for extra security, to verify that you are not a robot, you will go through 20 puzzles to match to verify that you are a human.
  4. After the sign in has been verified, write your username.
  5. After this process is finished, you will be directed to the homepage where details of your account are put on display.
  6. Select "new" to create a new repository.( here you can write a description,this is optional)
  7. Select either private or public ( to determine if you want only certain people to view the repository or if the general public can see it.
