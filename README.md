# IMAD5112_A1 - Creating a history-filled android application by ST10462553

# A functional Android application project written in Kotlin to enable users to input their age, prompting the app to  dislay information about historical figures and their age of passing.

This assignment was built to test the knowledge of students and to make an attempt towards building an application that may become useful or educational to potential users. Every aspect of this assignment is sample code which makes an attempt at reaching its goals and objectives towards the following:
* Enable the intake of user input specifically based on the age of the user
* Ensure that once a user inputs their age on the app, the app displays a message informing the user of the significance of the age inputted(by informing them of a famous figure who passed at that particular age).
* The user has the option of clearing their age history, thus the app resets and the user can enter either a new age or the same one to get a different famous figure's information.
* Error handling-wise, the app should prevent users from inputing values such as "37.5".The age must strictly be an integer "37", likeso.
* A functioning UI for user's convinient experience while navigating the app.
